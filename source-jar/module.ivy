	       		<p>This module provides source jar packaging feature.</p>
	       		
	       		<p>
	       			You can bind targets of this plugin to package phase by using bindtarget element in your module.ivy file.
	       			Example : 
	       			<code type="xml">
	       				<plugin name="source-jar" rev="0.1" as="source-jar"/>
		       			<!-- for main sources -->
		       			<bindtarget target="source-jar:main" tophase="package"/>
		       			<!-- for test sources -->
		       			<bindtarget target="source-jar:test" tophase="package"/>
		       		</code>
		       		Or as a nested element of the plugin
		       		<code type="xml">
	       				<plugin name="source-jar" rev="0.1" as="source-jar">
	       					<!-- here, the target prefix is not mandatory as easyant can determine it from plugin element -->
			       			<!-- for main sources -->
			       			<bindtarget target=":main" tophase="package"/>
			       			<!-- for test sources -->
			       			<bindtarget target=":test:test" tophase="package"/>
