           <p>
               This module provides features to install artifacts on a given repository.<br/>
               This module can be used in interactive (ie. let easyant ask questions) or directly from the command line by settings -Dproperty.<br/>
               By default interactive mode is enabled.<br/>
               If you prefer you can directly set the property on the command line.<br/>
           </p>
           <p>
               Example: 
               <div class="code">
                    easyant install-ext-artifact -Dorg=myOrgName -Dmodule=myModuleName -Drev=myRevisionNumber
               </div>
               Example2:
               <div class="code">
                    easyant install-artifact -Dorg=myOrgName -Dmodule=myModuleName -Drev=myRevisionNumber -Dartifact=myFile
               </div>
           </p>
           <p>
                If one of the property is not set, easyant will ask you the question if interactive mode is set to "true".
                If you want to disable interactive mode you should set "install.interactive.mode" property to "false".
           </p>
