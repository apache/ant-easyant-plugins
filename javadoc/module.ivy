            <p>This module provides javadoc feature.</p>
            <p>
                You can bind targets of this plugin to package phase by using bindtarget element in your module.ivy
                file.
                Example :
                <code type="xml">
                    <plugin name="javadoc" rev="0.1" as="javadoc" />
                    <bindtarget target="javadoc:package" tophase="package" />
                </code>
                Or as a nested element of the plugin
                <code type="xml">
                    <plugin name="javadoc" rev="0.1" as="javadoc">
                            <!-- here, the target prefix is not mandatory as easyant can determine it from plugin element -->
                        <bindtarget target=":package" tophase="package" />
                    </plugin>
                </code>
